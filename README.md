This program outputs a menu asking the user if they would like to buy something from the coffee machine, fill the coffee machine with ingredients, take the current amount of money, or view the remaining ingredients.

When entering buy, you are presented with four options: 

1 - espresso, 2 - latte, 3 - cappuccino, 4 - back to main menu:

pressing 1 for example would remove a set amount of water + coffeebeans from the current amount of ingredients in the machine.
